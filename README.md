# Personal Website Project

I build this project to practicing my coding and programming journey from 
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) Full-Stack Engineering Career 
Path. This personal website maybe just consisting of Front-End Engineering 
practice as my first experience of building something and portofolio. 
Another project consisting of Full-Stack Engineering will come in another 
episode. In the mean time, come and check it out of my progress in
